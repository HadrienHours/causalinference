To be laucnhed:
sudo ./script_web10G Period listvars_psqltypes user@caratroc testdb tablename `pwd`/logfiles.dir
    start modprobe
    Create table on psql machine based on the list of pars
    launch cnx_poll script
        control the connection every "period" ms filtering HTTP/HTTPS/PSQL/MySQL
        Each time a connection is present launch the create_cnx_log script
            create a logfile of the variables selected
            check if the connection is finished (state LastAck, FinWait or Closed)
                if No: Leave the log file
                if Yes:
                    check if already handled
                    If Yes : remove the log
                    If No:     Name the last log with "fin"
                        Launch the handle_end_cnx script
                            concatenate all log file based on (srcip,dstip,srcport,dstport) and create a csvfile
                            place the logfiles in treated.dir
                            place the csvfile in totreat.dir
                            launch the upload script
                                copy csvfile on psql machine
                                upload it to the dabase
                                rm the file from the database machine
                                mv the csvfile from totreat.dir to treated.dir


verbose: Two levels to be defined in each script
testp: If set to 1 then the port 80 is not filtered out (to test)
	wget http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad_download/download/tetrad-5.0.0-5.jar -O /dev/null

To stop the script
    ps aux | grep script
    sudo kill -9 %pid_of_script_web10G %pid_script_poll_cnxs

NB: To check if a cnxs is already handled and avoid the fact that connection is still present in listconns and was handled the script does not take into account the cnxs which start their first entry in the logs with a closed,fin-wait,last-ack state
